Aggregation vs composition ( No relation to cardinality, 1: many etc )

Simple rules:

1. A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A
2. A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists independently (conceptually) from A

Example 1:

A Company is an aggregation of People. A Company is a composition of Accounts. When a Company ceases to do business its Accounts cease to exist but its People continue to exist.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), the **"is-a"** and **"has-a"** relationships describe how different objects or classes relate to each other. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### **"Is-a" Relationship (Inheritance)**

- **Definition:** The "is-a" relationship is established through inheritance, where one class is a subclass of another.
- **Usage:** This indicates that the subclass is a specific type of the parent class. The subclass inherits behavior and attributes from the parent.
- **Example:** If you have a class `Animal` and a subclass `Dog`, the relationship between `Dog` and `Animal` is an "is-a" relationship because a `Dog` **is an** `Animal`.

```python
pythonCopy code
class Animal:
    pass

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

```

In this case, `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, so a `Dog` **is an** `Animal`.

### **"Has-a" Relationship (Composition/Aggregation)**

- **Definition:** The "has-a" relationship is established through composition or aggregation, where one class contains another class as a member or attribute.
- **Usage:** This indicates that one class **has** another class as part of its structure or functionality.
- **Example:** If you have a class `Car` and another class `Engine`, the relationship between `Car` and `Engine` is a "has-a" relationship because a `Car` **has an** `Engine`.

```python
pythonCopy code
class Engine:
    pass

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Car "has an" engine

```

In this case, `Car` contains an `Engine`, so a `Car` **has an** `Engine`.

### Summary:

- **"Is-a" relationship:** Inheritance between classes (e.g., `Dog` is an `Animal`).
- **"Has-a" relationship:** Composition or aggregation where one class is a part of another (e.g., `Car` has an `Engine`).
